\begin{proposition}[ICER generated by factor]
  \label{prop:icer2factor}
  Let $(X,T)$ and $(Y,T)$ be TDS and $\pi : X \to Y$ a factor map.
  Then 
  \begin{equation*}
    R:= \{ (x_1,x_2)  \in X \times X :  \pi (x_1) = \pi(x_2) \}
  \end{equation*}
  is an ICER and the map $\tilde{\pi}: X / R \to Y$ induced by $\pi$ is an isomorphism $(X/R,T) \to (Y,T)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Maximal equicontinuous factor]
  Let $(X,T)$ be a TDS.
  Then $(X,T)$ has an equicontinuous factor that is maximal in the sense that the ICER generated by it is the smallest with respect to set inclusion. This factor is called the \emph{maximal equicontinuous factor} (MEF) and it is unique up to isomorphism.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Existence:
  Let
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{R} := \{ R \subset X \times X : R \ \text{ICER with} \ X/R \ \text{equicontinuous}\}.
  \end{equation*}
  Then $ X \times X \in \mathcal{R}$ and so the set is non empty.
  If $\varphi : (X,T)\to (Y,T)$ is a factor with $(Y,T)$ equicontinuous and $R$ the Relation generated by $\varphi$, then $X/R$ is also equicontinuous, since $(X/R,T)$ is isomorphic to $(Y,T)$.
  Now let 
  \begin{equation*}
    R:= \cap \mathcal{R}.
  \end{equation*}
  Then $R$ is an ICER (because intersection of ICERs are ICERs).
  \textbf{Hier fehlt noch das Argument f√ºr die Metrisierbarkeit.}
  The product system $(\prod_{R^\prime \in \mathcal{R}} X/R^\prime,T)$ is equicontinuous, since products of equicontinuous systems are equicontinuous.
Consider the morphism $f:= X \ni x  \mapsto ([x]_{R^\prime})_{R^\prime \in \mathcal{R}}$.
  Let $A:= f(X)$, then $A$ is $T$-invariant being the image of a morphism.
  Furthermore $A$ is compact by continuity of $f$ and compactness of $X$.
  Since $A$ is a compact subset of a Hausdorff space it follows that $A$ is closed.
  Therefore we can consider the subsystem $(A,T)$ which is an equicontinuous system (subsystems of equicontinuous systems are equicontinuous).
  Consider the map $\pi: X \to  A , \  x  \mapsto ([x]_{R^\prime})_{R^\prime \in \mathcal{R}}$.
  Then $\pi$ is a factor and the ICER generated by $\pi$ is equal to $R$.
  Uniqueness:
  Any maximal equicontinuous factor generates the ICER $R$ and any two factors that generate $R$ are isomorphic to $(X/R,T)$ (proposition \ref{prop:icer2factor}).
\end{proof}
